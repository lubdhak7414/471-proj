This is a great start for the project’s README file! If you’re looking to make it more structured and user-friendly, here’s an improved version of it, including details about setting up the project with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), along with clear module descriptions. I’ve also added basic sections like installation, usage, and contribution.

# Repair Portal

## Project Overview

The **Repair Portal** is an online platform designed to connect users with technicians for various repair services. This platform allows users to create accounts, search for technicians, book repair services, track bookings, and interact with technicians through a seamless booking and payment system.

The project is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and focuses on providing an efficient and user-friendly experience for both users and technicians.
